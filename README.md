# YouTube-Downloader

Here in repository is a basic YouTube-Downloader.
This was my first project and first time EVER using Python, and I wanted to do something simple but useful in my own life.
I often find myself using sketchy YT2MP3 websites, to convert YouTube videos to MP3. So I figured as I was learning Python a little bit, why not create this.
This project was inspired first by a YouTube video suggesting ideas for automation with Python, as well as some bits of code/knowledge from Google/GitHub research.

I am not sure if I will continue to add to this, however I will most likely fix any bugs.

## Key Features:
  - Download YouTube videos in multiple file formats & qualities.
  - Download videos quickly & efficiently.
  - Handles errors.
  - File browser pop up for file selection.

## Notes:
  - In this repository, you will notice an exe file. This is NOT necessary, and all the source code is provided within the Python script.
  - If you do not wish to run the exe, you can run it on a VM or simply install the necessary packages for Python and run it via Python with the source code.
  - You can use the Free Trial for PySimpleGUI, or you can create a Free Hobbyist account and acquire a developer key.
